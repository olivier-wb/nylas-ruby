# How To Contribute
## Report a Bug or Request a Feature

If you encounter any bugs while using this software, or want to request a new feature or enhancement, please [create an issue to report it](https://github.com/nylas/nylas-ruby/issues), and make sure you add a label to indicate what type of issue it is.

## Contribute Code

Pull requests are welcome for bug fixes. If you want to implement something new, [please request a feature first so we can discuss it](https://github.com/nylas/nylas-ruby/issues).

While writing your code contribution, make sure you follow the testing conventions found in the [spec](https://github.com/nylas/nylas-ruby/tree/master/spec/nylas) [directory](https://github.com/nylas/nylas-ruby/tree/master/spec/nylas) for any components that you add. 

 - Pull requests may be submitted before they are feature complete to get feedback and thoughts from the core team.
 - Pull requests should pass tests across the supported versions of Ruby, as defined in .travis.yml. To do so, run bin/test.
 - Pull requests should add new tests to cover the functionality that is added or a bug that is fixed.

## Creating a Pull Request

Please follow [best practices](https://github.com/trein/dev-best-practices/wiki/Git-Commit-Best-Practices) for creating git commits. When your code is ready to be submitted, you can [submit a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) to begin the code review process.
